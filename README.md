### How to have common sense in AI? ###

Idea: These are the base units to represent and communicate common sense:

- noun
- verb
- adjective
- adverb

But, the above can be simplified...

- A noun is just a collection/set of adjectives [that are given a name].
  - Some adjectives in the group are more classifying than others in the group. Ex: The noun "cat" isn't necessarily distinguished by color, or the number of legs, or tail. But, certain kinds of cats can be.
- A verb is a noun over time... aka, verb is [mathematical] integral of noun.
- A verb is description of noun over time or at a certain time... aka, verb is [mathemtical] derivative of noun.
- An adverb is adjective of adjective (or adjective of another adverb).
- An adjective is a description.
- A description is a characteristic, which can be physical or behavioral.

Sidenote: My thinking is limited by using the calculus 'derivative' and 'integral'. There is something else that needs to go there, but I can't quite put my finger on it at this time. I'm  thinking something like 'tangential', but not particularly exactly. Something like 'aspect' or 'dimension', where each characteristic is 'parallel' and 'typically' unaffected by other characteristics. Somewhat mutually exclusive?

With these simplifications, things can be made in more absolutes and percentages.

Summary so far:

- Everything is a 'characteristic'.
- Group of one or more 'characteristic' is noun.



## Random Thoughts ##

- Things change, things have different meaning in different contexts. Can context always be defined?
  - Try random permutations. These can be simulated and not always done for real.
- Are there any verbs that are independent of time?
  - Some verbs can be thought of as a collection of changing characteristics over time (e.g., for running, the changing characteristic is foot movement). But, we can extrapolate from a still picture that a person was most likely running.
    - A certain still image of a person running can be viewed as 'a person standing on one leg'. Though, if time was progressing, then it could actually be a few different things instead. From other known things about our universe, we can rank the likeliness of which action a still image is representing.
  - It should be explicitly stated that there are likely verbs that don't need an adjective to change. Thus, there are verbs that don't depend on time.
